##Introduction and System Description

iMuseum is a distributed system to enhance the experience for a visitor in a museum: it uses IOT devices placed on each art piece to provide informations to the user through a mobile app using the bluetooth beacon mode.

Once the visit is over, the user will get a report of all the pieces seen in the visit.

The system also provides to the curator of the museum/exhibition all the informations about the devices status, a record of all the visitors along with the path and pieces seen inside the museum and all the informations about the sensors status to help notify the maintenance about possible malfunctions.
