This project models a distributed system to enhance the experience of a tour inside a museum joined with the collection of info for academic purposes along with the usual tour experience: the user can so enjoy the tour while getting all the research data he/she needs. This is basically implemented through a mobile app and an IoT sensor placed on each piece.

It also provides informations to the curator (or administrator) of the museum, mainly:

- All the visits that took place in the museum.
- The most viewed pieces along with all the favourite routes inside the museum/exhibition.
- A report on the sensors status.
