This project models a distributed system to enhance the experience of a tour inside a museum, provinding the visitors with a number of informations for each art piece through a mobile app and an IOT sensor placed on each piece.

It also provides informations to the curator (or administrator) of the museum, mainly:

- All the visits that took place in the museum.
- The most viewed pieces along with all the favourite routes inside the museum/exihibition.
- A report on the sensors status.
